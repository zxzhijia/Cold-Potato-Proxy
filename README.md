# Cold Potato Proxy
This is a proxy server that routes traffic in its network as close to the destination as possible, before letting it exit to the rest of the web.

In the computer network, routing among autonomous systems (AS) is interconnected in different areas. Hot-potato routing is the method of passing the internet traffic off to another AS framework as fast as could reasonably be expected, thus utilizing their system for wide-zone travel  cite 1. The basic properties of the hot potato routing are obstacles for the speed of light internet performance even though methods are used to improve hot-potato routing cite 2, 3.

Cool potato routing is the inverse of hot-potato routing, where the starting AS clutches the packet until it is as close to the destination as possible. Even though Cold-potato routing is more expensive to implement, it holds the traffic under your control for more, permitting operators of very much provisioned systems to offer better services to their clients.
